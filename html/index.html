<p><h2>About</h2></p>

<p>Bt Builder is an open source implementation of the Bard's Tale Construction
Set.  The eventual goal is to make a game builder that can implement the three
main Bard's Tale games in addition to Construction Set games.  Other possible
extensions include Wasteland and Dragon Wars.  The editor file formats and
custom pictures have been deciphered.  At current we do not intend to decipher
all file formats instead a new free collection of graphics and sounds will be
included with the game. The game interface is fairly usable at the moment. The
eidtor is usable but not very user friendly. Some elements are not editable
from the UI yet.</p>

<p>July 12, 2016: Bt Builder 0.5.9 released. PocketCHIP fix. Street names can
be added but are not visible in the editor. 'b' clears a street name from the
current square. 'n' allows you to select the street name or create a new one.
'm' sets the current square to the last used street name. When the game finds
street names it prints "You are on &gt;streetname&lt; facing &gt;direction&lt;."
when you press '?'. New images have been added. The die roll for encounters can
be adjusted. This allows you to have a chance for encounters of less thant 1
percent. Upgraded to SDL2.</p>
