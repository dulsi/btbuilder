if it hasn't changed. Fix left shift key. Modify how the label under the image

<p>May 9, 2014: Bt Builder 0.4.5 released. Added copy functionality to
monsters, items and spells. Some more images were added. Monsters and spells
are sorted when selecting one to edit. Unfortunately when you need to select
one for some other reason like summon monster, sorting is not applied yet.

You can now save a game. You will be asked to if you want to restore when you
load the module. Currently "clear special" and "set special" effects are not

Tale Construction Set now available. Most images have been removed from the

the fields to the spell editor.</p>

has been added. The item editor allows you to edit everything but isn't very
user friendly. The spell editor is more of a work in progress.</p>

<p>Oct 14, 2013: Bt Builder 0.3.14 released. Fixed a bug with page down on lists
that are less than a full page. Bt Builder now tries to load .xml files in
preference to .MAP files. If a .xml and .MAP file have the same prefix, the map
editor will only display the .xml file. The map editor no longer saves a broken
.MAP file if it determines that the map has features that are not supported in
that format. A very primitive monster editor has been added. It doesn't allow
you to edit all the fields yet.</p>

<p>Oct 7, 2013: Bt Builder 0.3.13 released. You can now add new specials to
a map. Baylor's Spell Bind is available for Bt Builder specific modules. It
only works on a single creature at the moment. The effect only works when
specified as a single target. Eventually it will be enhanced to work on a
group. It only has an effect at Start. Run and End effects are nothing.</p>

new wilderness graphics. Added a primitive map editor. The map editor only
edits the walls and allows placement of specials. Creating specials can't be
done at the moment. It allows resizing a map but walls at the edges are not
corrected so they may be only one way. It can save the BTCS map file format
if no Bt Builder only features are used.</p>

<p>Oct 7, 2012: Bt Builder 0.3.8 released. Fixed the sample game to allow you
to talk to the queen after defeating Dral. Added the ability to switch to
full screen by pressing F12. Modified image loading code to support higher

image is not available.</p>

sneak attack now only work with melee weapons. Dispell illusion and dispell

spell icons are in the build but they do not animate in the game yet. Lots
of new wall tiles are available. Modified the sample games a bit.</p>

<p>Sep 28, 2012: Bt Builder 0.3.6 released. Hide in shadows now critically
hits. It also informs you that you succeeded or failed. Monsters and
characters have gender. Character creation allows you to specify the
character's gender. Added music for the safety song. Made a second demo game.
The second demo is currently the same as the first except it allows 12 items
per character, uses xml files for many files and has proper plural names for
monsters.</p>

<p>Sep 25, 2012: Bt Builder 0.3.5 released. Hide in shadows is partially
working. It doesn't critically hit yet. The xml monster files now support a
plural name instead of just adding "(s)". Various bug fixes and compile fix
for new libpng. New slot images. Support for a larger number of item slots.</p>

<p>Sep 18, 2012: Bt Builder 0.3.4 released. Rate of attacks not increased
properly. Buying spell levels doesn't always work properly. XP needed didn't
display when you don't have enough XP to advance. Increase monk's bare hands

inventory than the first nine items. Items sold to the shop are available
for purchase. Silence zones do not allow new songs. Support for walls that
are immune to phase door. Fixed quitting under windows. Clicking on the close
button will also work now although it doesn't warn you about losing your
