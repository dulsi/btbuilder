multiple effects. Spell editor had to be redesigned. City tiles have been
updated.</p>

<p>Jun 17, 2014: Bt Builder 0.4.6 released. Fixed a crash bug when finding
traps and trying to cast spells with a non-caster. Shield icon is only
displayed for party effects. It still displays for armor class penalty spells
that affect everyone.</p>

<p>May 9, 2014: Bt Builder 0.4.5 released. Added copy functionality to
monsters, items and spells. Some more images were added. Monsters and spells
are sorted when selecting one to edit. Unfortunately when you need to select
one for some other reason like summon monster, sorting is not applied yet.
Trade gold implemented. Monster names displayed when casting a spell on them.
You can now save a game. You will be asked to if you want to restore when you
load the module. Currently "clear special" and "set special" effects are not
saved. Music is not restored but the effect of the bard song is.

<p>Apr 14, 2014: Bt Builder 0.4.4 released. More images from opengameart.org
added. Allow the user to select a map file by name on teleport special
commands or type in a new file name if the file doesn't currently exist.
Replace goto line number with goto and labels. Old files are automatically
upgraded. Pressing 'c' when select a special will make a copy and bring up the
editor for the copy.</p>

<p>Mar 24, 2014: Bt Builder 0.4.3 released. All functionality found in Bard's
Tale Construction Set now available. Most images have been removed from the
release due a license conflict. Some images from opengameart.org have been
added. Editing a picture for a monster or a draw picture special command now
displays the image. The old images are available for download if you wish to
continue using them.</p>

<p>Mar 6, 2014: Bt Builder 0.4.2 released. Chance of encounters can be edited
on the map preferences screen. Crashing when summoning illusions has been
fixed. Archmage can no longer change class into archmage. The Builder City
module has more events in it. Builder City 2 has not been updated.</p>

<p>Feb 14, 2014: Bt Builder 0.4.1 released. Fixed a bug where a rogue would
stay hidden if they were hidden at the end of a combat. Implemented altering
the speed of text in combat with the '+' and '-' keys. Identify is now
available at the shop. Added some validity checks to loading the walls.xml so
that the user is alerted to problems with the file.</p>

<p>Jan 15, 2014: Bt Builder 0.4.0 released. Fixed a bug that caused the old
BTCS formats to not save properly. Running is no longer automatic. Combat
actions can be edited in the monster editor although it is not very user
friendly.</p>

<p>Dec 26, 2013: Bt Builder 0.3.19 released. Fixed a bug that could crash the
game when using the monk. Updated the images. Reimplemented initiative to take
dexterity and luck into account.</p>

<p>Oct 25, 2013: Bt Builder 0.3.18 released. Fix a bug for displaying walls
when wrapping to other side of the map. Added the ability to specify xp for
monsters. Modified string editing in the special editor to support line
wrapping.</p>

<p>Oct 23, 2013: Bt Builder 0.3.17 released. Fix a bug that causes Bt Builder
to crash when editing special commands on occassion. Fixed the delete key in
the special editor under Windows. New main screen with information on using
the editor added. Bt Builder now returns to the main screen after editing or
playing a module instead of exiting. Added a levitation spell. It doesn't do
anything by itself. Added new conditional "$E is active". It determines if a
spell effect is active. With this conditional you can have places that allow
you to levitate up.</p>

<p>Oct 22, 2013: Bt Builder 0.3.16 released. Fix a bug that causes Bt Builder
to crash when editing some monsters or creating new ones. Add the rest of
the fields to the spell editor.</p>

<p>Oct 21, 2013: Bt Builder 0.3.15 released. A primitive item and spell editor
has been added. The item editor allows you to edit everything but isn't very
user friendly. The spell editor is more of a work in progress.</p>

<p>Oct 14, 2013: Bt Builder 0.3.14 released. Fixed a bug with page down on lists
that are less than a full page. Bt Builder now tries to load .xml files in
preference to .MAP files. If a .xml and .MAP file have the same prefix, the map
editor will only display the .xml file. The map editor no longer saves a broken
.MAP file if it determines that the map has features that are not supported in
that format. A very primitive monster editor has been added. It doesn't allow
you to edit all the fields yet.</p>

<p>Oct 7, 2013: Bt Builder 0.3.13 released. You can now add new specials to
a map. Baylor's Spell Bind is available for Bt Builder specific modules. It
only works on a single creature at the moment. The effect only works when
specified as a single target. Eventually it will be enhanced to work on a
group. It only has an effect at Start. Run and End effects are nothing.</p>

<p>Apr 15, 2013: Bt Builder 0.3.12 released. A primative special editor is
implemented. See the <a href="edit.html">editor page</a> for more information.

up and down implemented on select lists.</p>

a combat during a special. Fix map resizing to not leave one way walls.
Explain how to use map editor in readme. Animated spell icons. Fixed some
spell damage text to not end with "and". Allow a monster to not be found in
random encounters. Fixed missing files from map editor list. Removed some non
map files for map editor list. Implemented play sound special. Fixed animation
timing. Darkness zone stops new lights but allows a flash of light unlike BTCS
implementation. Added light level in map files. Support for multiple groups of
monsters in random encounters. Higher resolution graphics for lots of things
added.</p>

<p>Oct 14, 2012: Bt Builder 0.3.10 released. Use 'e' on a module to load
primitive map editor.</p>

<p>Oct 13, 2012: Bt Builder 0.3.9 released. Added some 640x400 images. Added
new wilderness graphics. Added a primitive map editor. The map editor only
edits the walls and allows placement of specials. Creating specials can't be
done at the moment. It allows resizing a map but walls at the edges are not
corrected so they may be only one way. It can save the BTCS map file format
if no Bt Builder only features are used.</p>

<p>Oct 7, 2012: Bt Builder 0.3.8 released. Fixed the sample game to allow you
to talk to the queen after defeating Dral. Added the ability to switch to
full screen by pressing F12. Modified image loading code to support higher
resolution but fallback to lower quality image if the higher resolution
image is not available.</p>

<p>Oct 5, 2012: Bt Builder 0.3.7 released. Hunter's critical hits and thief's
sneak attack now only work with melee weapons. Dispell illusion and dispell
magic implemented. This required heavy changes to spell expiration. Animated
spell icons are in the build but they do not animate in the game yet. Lots
of new wall tiles are available. Modified the sample games a bit.</p>

<p>Sep 28, 2012: Bt Builder 0.3.6 released. Hide in shadows now critically
hits. It also informs you that you succeeded or failed. Monsters and
characters have gender. Character creation allows you to specify the
character's gender. Added music for the safety song. Made a second demo game.
The second demo is currently the same as the first except it allows 12 items
per character, uses xml files for many files and has proper plural names for
monsters.</p>

<p>Sep 25, 2012: Bt Builder 0.3.5 released. Hide in shadows is partially
working. It doesn't critically hit yet. The xml monster files now support a
plural name instead of just adding "(s)". Various bug fixes and compile fix
for new libpng. New slot images. Support for a larger number of item slots.</p>

<p>Sep 18, 2012: Bt Builder 0.3.4 released. Rate of attacks not increased
properly. Buying spell levels doesn't always work properly. XP needed didn't
display when you don't have enough XP to advance. Increase monk's bare hands
damage as they advance in level.</p>

<p>Sep 17, 2012: Bt Builder 0.3.3 released. Shops can now have different
inventory than the first nine items. Items sold to the shop are available
for purchase. Silence zones do not allow new songs. Support for walls that
are immune to phase door. Fixed quitting under windows. Clicking on the close
button will also work now although it doesn't warn you about losing your
progress like it does when you use 'q' to quit. Lots of new graphics.</p>

special attacks for monsters. Implemented item-zot. Fixed a bug in writing xml
